<summary>Add category</summary>

## Feature:
Add Category for Expense
### What could go wrong:
- Have to do two migrations. First add the category table and the column for category id in expenses table, make it nullable. Then fill in category for all expenses. Then make another migration to make the column category_id required. 

### After adding this feature:
- Think about what to do if a category is deleted. Where do we want to put its expenses. Or we just not allow deleting categories that have expenses.
- User has not been added yet.
